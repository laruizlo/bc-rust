//! This page documents advanced features of the Module Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA)
//! available in this crate.
//!
//!
//! # Streaming APIs
//!
//! Sometimes the message that needs to be signed or verified is too big to fit in device memory all at once.
//! No worries, we got you covered!
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // For illustration purposes, assume that this message was so long that it couldn't possibly
//! // be streamed in its entirety over a network, and therefore it needs to be pre-hashed.
//! let msg_chunk1 = b"The quick brown fox ";
//! let msg_chunk2 = b"jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut signer = MLDSA65::sign_init(&sk, None).unwrap();
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk1);
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk2);
//! let sig = signer.sign_final().unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that can be saved to a file or whatever it is needed.
//!
//! // This is compatible with a verifies that takes the whole message as one chunk:
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//!
//! // But of course there's also a streaming API for the verifier!
//! let mut verifier = MLDSA65::verify_init(&pk, None).unwrap();
//! verifier.verify_update(msg_chunk1);
//! verifier.verify_update(msg_chunk2);
//!
//! match verifier.verify_final(&sig.as_slice()) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! Note that the streaming API also supports setting the signing context `ctx` and signing nonce `rnd`,
//! which are explained in more detail below.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // For illustration purposes, assume that this message was so long that it couldn't possibly
//! // be streamed in its entirety over a network, and therefore it needs to be pre-hashed.
//! let msg_chunk1 = b"The quick brown fox ";
//! let msg_chunk2 = b"jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut signer = MLDSA65::sign_init(&sk, Some(b"signing ctx value")).unwrap();
//! signer.set_signer_rnd([0u8; 32]); // an all-zero rnd is the "deterministic" mode of ML-DSA
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk1);
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk2);
//! let sig = signer.sign_final().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # External Mu mode
//!
//! Here, `mu` refers to the message digest which is computed internally to the ML-DSA algorithm:
//!
//! > 𝜇 ← H(BytesToBits(𝑡𝑟)||𝑀′, 64)
//! >   ▷ message representative that may optionally be computed in a different cryptographic module
//!
//! The External Mu mode of ML-DSA fulfills a similar function to [`hash_mldsa`] in that it allows large
//! messages to be pre-digested outside of the cryptographic module that holds the private key,
//! but it does it in a way that is compatible with the ML-DSA verification function.
//! In other works, whereas [`hash_mldsa`] represents a different signature algorithm, the external mu
//! mode of ML-DSA is simply internal implementation detail of how the signature was computed and
//! produces signatures that are indistinguishable from "direct" ML-DSA mode.
//!
//! The one potential complication with external mu mode -- that [`hash_mldsa`] does not have --
//! is that it requires the user to know the public key that they are about to sign the message with.
//! Or, more specifically, the hash of the public key `tr`.
//! `tr` is a public value (derivable from the public key), so there is no harm in, for example,
//! sending it down to a client device so that it can pre-hash a large message and only send the
//! 64-byte `mu` value up to the server to be signed.
//! But in some contexts, the message has to be pre-hashed for performance reasons but
//! the public key that will be used for signing cannot be known in advance.
//! For those use cases, the only choice is to use [`hash_mldsa`].
//!
//! This library exposes [`MuBuilder`] which can be used to pre-hash a large to-be-signed message
//! along with the public key hash `tr`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let (pk, _) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Let's pretend this message was so long that it couldn't possibly
//! // streamed in its entirety over a network, and it needs to be pre-hashed.
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(&pk.compute_tr(), msg, None).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Note: binding a `ctx` value (explained below) needs to be done in [`MuBuilder::compute_mu`].
//!
//! If the message really is so huge that it can't all be held in memory at once, then it might
//! be preferable to use a streaming API for computing mu:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let (pk, _) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Let's pretend this message was so long that it couldn't possibly
//! // streamed in its entirety over a network, and it needs to be pre-hashed.
//! let msg_chunk1 = b"The quick brown fox ";
//! let msg_chunk2 = b"jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut mb = MuBuilder::do_init(&pk.compute_tr(), None).unwrap();
//! mb.do_update(msg_chunk1);
//! mb.do_update(msg_chunk2);
//! let mu = mb.do_final();
//! ```
//!
//! Given a mu value, it is possible to compute a signature that verifies as normal (no mu's required!):
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Assume this was computed somewhere else and received by the user.
//! // Then the sender would have had to know pk!
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(&pk.compute_tr(), msg, None).unwrap();
//!
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign_mu(&sk, &mu).unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that can be saved to a file or whatever it is need.
//!
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! # Ctx and Rnd params
//! Various functions in this crate allows setting the signing context value (`ctx`) and the signing nonce (`rnd`).
//! Here is an overview of both:
//!
//! ## ctx
//! The `ctx` value allows the signer to bind the signature value to an extra piece of information
//! (up to 255 bytes long) that must also be known to the verifier in order to successfully verify the signature.
//! This optional parameter allows cryptographic protocol designers to get additional binding properties
//! from the ML-DSA signature.
//! The `ctx` value should be something that is known to both the signer and verifier,
//! does not necessarily need to be a secret, but should not go over the wire as part of the not-yet-verified message.
//! Examples of uses of the `ctx` could include binding the application data type (ex: `FooEmailData`) in order
//! to disambiguate other data types that share an encoding (ex: `FooTextDocumentData`) and might otherwise be possible for an
//! attacker to trick a verifier into accepting one in place of the other.
//! In a network protocol, `ctx` could be used to bind a transaction ID or protocol nonce in order to strongly
//! protect against replay attacks.
//! Generally, it is safe to ignore any property about a `ctx` object that is not well understood.
//!
//! Example of signing and verifying with a `ctx` value:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait};
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox";
//! let ctx = b"FooTextDocumentFormat";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign(&sk, msg, Some(ctx)).unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that can be saved to a file or whatever it is needed.
//!
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, Some(ctx), &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## rnd
//!
//! This is the signature nonce, whose purpose is to ensure that every time a signature is computed for the same
//! message, it results in a different value
//!
//! In general, the "deterministic" mode of ML-DSA (which usually uses an all-zero `rnd`) is considered
//! secure and safe to use, however, certain privacy properties may be lost. For example,
//! it becomes evident that multiple identical signatures means that the same message was signed multiple times
//! by the same private key.
//!
//! The default mode of ML-DSA uses a `rnd` generated by the library's OS-backed RNG, the `rnd` can be set by the user
//! if necessary; for example if the function is run on an embedded device that does not have access to an RNG.
//!
//! Note that in order to avoid combinatorial explosion of API functions, setting the `rnd` value is only
//! available in conjunction with external mu or streaming modes. The example of setting `rnd` on the streaming
//! API was shown above.
//!
//! Here is an example of using the [`MLDSA::sign_mu_deterministic`] function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Assume this was computed somewhere else, then
//! // the party that computed it would have had to know pk
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(&pk.compute_tr(), msg, None).unwrap();
//!
//! // Typically, "deterministic" mode of ML-DSA will use an all-zero `rnd`,
//! // but here it is exposed it so it can be set any value, as needed.
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign_mu_deterministic(&sk, &mu, [0u8; 32]).unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that can saved to a file or whatever it is needed.
//!
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # sign_from_seed
//!
//! This mode is intended for users with extreme performance or resource-limitation requirements.
//!
//! A very careful analysis of the ML-DSA signing algorithm will show that
//! the entire ML-DSA private key does not need to be in memory at the same time.
//! In fact, it is possible to merge the keygen() and sign() functions
//!
//! The code provides [`MLDSA::sign_mu_deterministic_from_seed`] which implements such an algorithm.
//! It has a significantly lower peak-memory-footprint than the regular signing API (although there's
//! always room for more optimization), and according to our benchmarks it is only around 25% slower
//! than signing with a fully-expanded private key -- which is still faster than performing a full
//! keygen followed by a regular sign since there are intermediate values common to keygen and sign
//! that the merged function is able to only compute once.
//!
//! Since this is intended for hard-core embedded systems people, this has not been wrapped in all
//! the beginner-friendly APIs. It is implied that a user that needs this functionality also knows how
//! to use it and what they are doing
//!
//! Example usage:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, SignatureVerifier};
//! use bouncycastle_core::key_material::{KeyMaterial256, KeyType, KeyMaterialTrait};
//! use bouncycastle_hex as hex;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA44, MLDSA44_SIG_LEN, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let seed = KeyMaterial256::from_bytes_as_type(
//!     &hex::decode("000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f").unwrap(),
//!     KeyType::Seed,
//! ).unwrap();
//!
//! // The public key is computed so that the signature can be verified by anyone.
//! // It also computes the hash `tr` of the public key to later be used to bind the public key at the time of signing.
//! // There is no short-cut to efficiently computing the public key or `tr` from the seed;
//! // The full keygen need to be run in order to get the full private key, at least momentarily, then
//! // it can be discarded and only keep `tr` and `seed`.
//! let (pk, _) = MLDSA44::keygen_from_seed(&seed).unwrap();
//! let tr: [u8; 64] = pk.compute_tr();
//!
//! // Assume this was computed somewhere else, then
//! // the party that computed it would have had to know pk
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(&tr, msg, None).unwrap();
//! let rnd: [u8; 32] = [0u8; 32]; // with this API, the user is responsible for their own nonce
//!                                // because in the cases where this level of memory optimization
//!                                // is needed, our RNG probably won't work anyway.
//!
//! let mut sig = [0u8; MLDSA44_SIG_LEN];
//! let bytes_written = MLDSA44::sign_mu_deterministic_from_seed_out(&seed, &mu, rnd, &mut sig).unwrap();
//!
//! // it can be verified normally
//! match MLDSA44::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! While this is currently only supported when operating from a seed-based private key, something analogous
//! could be done that merges the sk_decode() and sign() routines when working with the standardized
//! private key encoding (which is often called the "semi-expanded format" since the in-memory representation
//! is still larger).
//! Contact us if you need such a thing implemented.
//!
//! # Suspending and resuming execution via SerializableState
//!
//! When signing or verifying a large message, it can be advantageous to be able to suspend the operation
//! to a cache and resume it later; for example if waiting for the message to stream over a slow network
//! connection.
//!
//! This can bo accomplished for both the ML-DSA signer and verifier through the [`MuBuilder`] object.
//!
//! Suspending an in-progress sign operation:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MuBuilder, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait};
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, Suspendable};
//!
//! let msg_part1 = b"The quick brown fox";
//! let msg_part2 = b" jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! let mut mb = MuBuilder::do_init(&pk.compute_tr(), None).unwrap();
//! mb.do_update(msg_part1);
//!
//! // here, we'll suspend while "waiting" for the second part of the message
//! let serialized_state = mb.suspend();
//!
//! // ...
//! // do other things in the meantime
//! // ...
//!
//! let mut mb_resumed = MuBuilder::from_suspended(serialized_state).unwrap();
//! mb_resumed.do_update(msg_part2);
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = mb_resumed.do_final();
//!
//! // Now we'll do the actual sign_mu operation
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign_mu(&sk, &mu).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Suspending an in-progress verify operation behaves exactly the same way:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa_lowmemory::{MLDSA65, MuBuilder, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait};
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{Signer, Suspendable};
//! use bouncycastle_core::errors::SignatureError;
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // first, let's generate a signature to verify
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign(&sk, b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", None).unwrap();
//!
//! // Now we'll verify it with a suspension in the middle
//! let msg_part1 = b"The quick brown fox";
//! let msg_part2 = b" jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut mb = MuBuilder::do_init(&pk.compute_tr(), None).unwrap();
//! mb.do_update(msg_part1);
//!
//! // here, we'll suspend while "waiting" for the second part of the message
//! let serialized_state = mb.suspend();
//!
//! // ...
//! // do other things in the meantime
//! // ...
//!
//! let mut mb_resumed = MuBuilder::from_suspended(serialized_state).unwrap();
//! mb_resumed.do_update(msg_part2);
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = mb_resumed.do_final();
//!
//! // Now we'll do the actual verify_mu operation
//! match MLDSA65::verify_mu(&pk, &mu, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
