//! RNG objects for cryptographically secure random number generation.
//!
//! This crate provides the implementations of the deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) algorithms
//! which, together with a strong entropy source, form the basis of cryptographic random number generation.
//!
//! Here is the basic way to get some random bytes:
//!
//! ```
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::RNG;
//! use bouncycastle_rng as rng;
//!
//! let random_bytes = rng::DefaultRNG::default().next_bytes(32);
//! ```
//! This is secure because `::default()` seeds the RNG from the OS, configured for general use.
//!
//! **WARNING: most people should stop reading here and should not attempt to modify the internals of RNGs.
//! This crate contains dragons and other horrible things. 🐉🐍🐜**
//!
//! # 🚨🚨🚨Security Warning 🚨🚨🚨
//!
//! Misuse of the objects in this crate can lead to output which may appear random, but
//! is in fact completely deterministic (ie multiple runs of your application will give the same outputs)
//! and will therefore compromise any cryptographic operation built on top of those outputs.
//! You should only be here if your application requires direct control over configuring the internals of the DRBG.
//!
//! This crate contains the [`Sp80090ADrbg`] trait, which is intentionally defined here and not in [`bouncycastle_core::traits`]
//! since misuse of [`Sp80090ADrbg::instantiate`] can completely undermine the security of your entire
//! cryptographic application.
